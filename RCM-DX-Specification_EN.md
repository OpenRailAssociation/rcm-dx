## Introduction  

### Motivation  

Railroad companies continuously gather data of their rail, overhead line, telecommunications, civil engineering structure and signaling systems by means of mobile and stationary measuring systems. Data flows from these systems through processing units -- which enrich, evaluate and validate the data --, to systems that display the data to subject matter experts and also to systems that automatically analyse it.

This specification defines the rail condition monitoring data exchange format (RCM-DX format) which is a data format optimised for data in the railroad context, i.e. for data points localised within a railroad network. The RCM-DX format is a file format based on the HDF5 specification and defines a structure of HDF5 groups, datasets, and attributes. The document at hands also describes the content of the elements defined. Although the format is open and can in principle be implemented right away by any railroad company, this specification contains a few non-generic elements and naming conventions that are specific to SBB and Infrabel. The reason for this is that any file that adheres to this specification can be used with the _RCM Viewer_, an application available soon to the public.

The RCM-DX format is a file format detailing the HDF5 format version 2.0. HDF5 was chosen for several reasons, including that it is an open format. HDF5 is a hierarchical data storage where the data in arranged in a tree structure. The HDF5 format is described on the webpage of the [HDF5-group](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/), in particular on the site [HDF5 file format specification](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Introduction+to+HDF5). The HDF5 group offers tools and libraries for various programming languages and operating systems that allow to read and write HDF5 files.

### Hints

#### RCM-DX structure

RCM-DX defines a structure of HDF5 groups, datasets, and attributes that software solutions that use this format must adhere to.  
The extension of the specification is permitted. However, it must be taken into account that such data may no longer be read or processed by existing systems.  

#### Versioning

The RCM-DX data format is subject to changes, these are indicated by the version number in the document, see chapter [Root](#root). The version number consists of two numbers, separated by dots and is composed as follows: **[Major].[Minor].[Feature]**. Example: **1.0.0**  

**Major**  
Defines the main version and indicates when major changes have been made. These are, for example, that changing the basic structure or renaming groups, datasets or attributes (major, minor attribute as an example), which are mandatory.

**Minor**  
Indicates minor changes, such as changing the name of an attribute that is not mandatory or defining new groups, attributes, or datasets. These changes do not affect anything that cannot be read with an existing RCM-DX read-write library.

**Feature**  
Indicates feature changes.

#### Diagrams

The following figure shows the color coding used in diagrams:

![RCM-DX diagram overview](images/generated/rcmdx_diagram_example.png){width=320px}

## Definitions

This document defines technical restrictions as well as content descriptions. This chapter provides an overview of the data types used, types of names, and other important points.

### File names

Files following the RCM-DX specification get their own defined file extension, which is `rcmdx`.  

Example of a file name: `20201228_081522_TGMS.rcmdx`.

### Primitive and extended data types

#### Primitive data types

Below are the supported data types used in this specification including a short description.
Not all data types possible with HDF5 are described. The read and write library specifies which data types can be used for data sets and attributes.

| Data type | Description | Examples |
|---|----|----|
| boolean | Two values are possible, `true` or `false`, `0` or `1` | `true` |
| byte | One byte or an unlimited number of bytes are possible | - |
| signed integer | Positive and negative values are allowed. Possible bit depths are: 8, 16, 32 or 64 | `1256442`; `-62334` |
| unsigned integer | Only positive values are allowed. Possible bit depths are: 8, 16, 32 or 64 | `1256442`; `-62334` |
| float | Positive and negative values are allowed. Possible bit depths are: 32 or 64 | `12.53`; `-3212.546` |
| string | Multiple characters of undefined length | "RCM-DX is great!" |

#### Extended data types

Extended data types use the primitive data types, but have a more specialized format or meaning. The following is a list of the extended data types used.

| Name | Description | Example |
|--|-----|---|
| Timestamp | Unique and worldwide defined format of a time in nanoseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00 UTC without leap seconds, defined under [wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp). Datatype is `64 bit unsigned integer` | `1553237099000000000` |
| Enum | Enumerations are predefined (and always capitalized) strings defined in this specification. Datatype is `string` | `MAX`, `MIN`, `RIGHT`, `LEFT` |

### (HDF5) Group

If we are talking about a group in this document, we mean the groups in HDF5 format (of the type `HDF5 Group`). These contain additional groups or datasets.

If a name of a group in this document is written in capital letters (for example `TOPOLOGY`), it is exactly the same as in the RCM-DX file. If the naming of a group is not fixed, the corresponding chapter describes in more detail how the name is composed.

Groups are described in this specification as follows:

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| `GROUP` | `RCMDX` | no |

**Name**  
The name of the group.

> Group names whose ending is "_NAME" are wildcard names and are replaced as described in the corresponding paragraph. Example: *GROUP_NAME*

**Parent object**  
A group can be a subgroup of a group, here the name of this group is mentioned. If the name is written in quotation marks, it can be freely chosen by the creator of the file. Without quotation marks, the name of the group is meant.

**Optional**  
If a group is marked as optional (`optional = yes`), it can be omitted if it is not needed. If a group is marked as non-optional (`Optional = no`), then this group must exist if the parent group also exists, otherwise it does not.

### (HDF5) Attribute

In the RCM-DX, attributes, groups and datasets can be assigned. The names of the attributes are written in the UpperCamelCase-Notation^1^. Attributes are always of type `HDF5 attribute` unless otherwise specified.

Attributes are described in this specification as follows:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|---|---|-----|
| StartTime | 64 bit integer | *SESSION_NAME* | no | Start time in miliseconds, for example: `1553237099000000000` |

**Name**  
The name of the attribute.

**Data type**  
Primitive data type of the attribute, this describes the type of the content in the attribute itself.

**Parent object**  
An attribute is always assigned to a group or a data set, here the name of this group or data set is mentioned.

**Optional**  
If an attribute is marked as optional (`Optional = yes`), it can be omitted if it is not required. If an attribute is marked as non-optional (`Optional = no`), this attribute must be present if the group or dataset to which the attribute applies is also present, otherwise it is not.

**Description**  
Description and or examples of the attribute.

^1^Upper-Camel-Case-Notation: The Upper Camel Case Notation defines the way a composite name is written. Further information can be found at the following link: [Upper Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)

### (HDF5) Datasets

A data set is the structure in which data is stored. Examples of data are sensor, measurement, or position data. 
A data set is always of the HDF5 type `HDF5 Dataset`. In the HDF5 Specification a "Dataset" is a container for data objects.
A channel as a group always has one data set. A channel defines a type of sensor data that is stored in its data set. Several channels form a data source. Further information on the structure is described further down in this specification.

Below is a list of possible ways in which data can be stored in the RCM-DX:

| Type of storage | Description |
|---|------|
| Array | Data array of arbitrary length |
| Image | An image taken at a defined time |
| Video | A video that has been streamed into several individual blocks of defined size, split and saved |

The datasets are described in the lowerCamelCase-Notation^2^. Datasets are described in this specification as follows:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|--|---|----|---|-----|
| timestamp | Timestamp | *DATASOURCE_NAME* | no | `Array` |

**Name**  
The name of the data set.

**Data type**  
Primitive data type of the content in the data set, thus the data type of the contained data.

**Parent object**  
A data set is always assigned to a group, here the name of this group is mentioned.

**Optional**  
If the dataset is marked as optional (`Optional = yes`), it can be omitted if it is not needed. If the dataset is marked as non-optional (`Optional = no`), this dataset must be present if the parent group also has these datasets, otherwise not.

**Storage type**  
One of the storage types described in this chapter.

Descriptions of the data set are added outside the table.  

**^2^lower-Camel-Case-Notation**: The lower camel case notation defines the way a composite name is written. Further information can be found under the following link: [www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)

#### HDF5 Chunking

The "HDF5 Chunking" is for data within a data set. This means that the data is divided into blocks, which in turn can be processed independently. This also allows faster access to parts of the data. Whether a splitting is allowed and recommended can be seen with each data set, for example: "HDF5 Chunking" is allowed and recommended. The HDF5 chunking is described in more detail on the website of the HDF5 group: [www.support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.user/Chunking.html](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.user/Chunking.html)

## Data structures

Within a channel group, one of the following structures can be contained: Array, Limits, Coordinates, Pictures or Videos. These structures are described in more detail in this chapter.  

### Array

Channels which record individual measured values contain a data set with the name `data`, this data set is never optional. Single values are stored in this data set as a 1D array, the length of this array (or list) is not limited.

The possible data types are defined in chapter [Primitiv and extended data types](#primitive-and-extended-data-types)

Multidimensional measured values are given their own channel group per dimension and thus their own data set called `data`.

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|----|---|----|---|----|
| data | A primitive or extended data type | *CHANNEL_NAME* | no | `Array` |

The following attributes are assigned to this type of data set:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|---|---|-----|
| `Unit` | string | data set `data` | no | A physical unit or empty if the data does not correspond to a physical unit |

#### Limits

Limits are stored in group `LIMIT`. Limits are threshold values for measurements. They are used for comparison and analysis of measurements. 

A channel group can contain zero or one limit groups. Each limit sub-group *`LIMIT_NAME`* contains its own `timestamp` data set and contains a `duration` data set. The data set `limitvalue` contains the limit values. When which limit value is valid is defined in the dataset `timestamp` and how long it is valid is defined in the dataset `duration`. Values at the same index position of all three data resources belong together.

![Limit group overview](images/generated/rcmdx_limit_group.png){width=320px}

The group of limit values is defined as follows:

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| `LIMIT` | *CHANNEL_NAME* | no |

The group `LIMIT` now contains further groups, each with the name of the limit exceeding:

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| *LIMIT_NAME* | `LIMIT` | no |

The following attributes are assigned to this group:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|---|---|-----|
| Priority | 8 bit integer | *LIMIT_NAME* | no | Priority of defined limit, lower values are higher priorities. |
| LimitBound | Enum | *LIMIT_NAME* | no | Defines the type of limit, possible values are `MAX` or `MIN`. |

It contains the following datasets:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|----|---|----|---|----|
| limitvalue | A primitive or extended data type | *LIMIT_NAME* | no | `Array` |
| timestamp | Timestamp | *LIMIT_NAME* | no | `Array` |
| duration | Timestamp | *LIMIT_NAME* | no | `Array` |

### Coordinates

Measurement data that can be assigned to a coordinate system are given a defined name according to the following pattern: `coord.CN`.  
This type of data storage allows several entries to be recorded per measurement timestamp. Thus there are more entries in these datasets than in the data set `timestamp`. How many entries per timestamp belong to each other (as a group) is stored in another data set with the name `sampleindex`. The data set `sampleindex` is described in chapter [Sample index](#sample-index).

| Element | Description |
|--|------|
| coord | Simple character string for identifying data of type Coordinates |
| . | Separators
| C | Additional character for identifying data of type Coordinates |
| N | Index number beginning with "0", increasing for each additional coordinate datasets |

The data set is defined as follows:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|--|------|--|--|--|
| coord.CN | A primitive or extended data type | *CHANNEL_NAME* | no | Single |

The following attributes are assigned to this type of data set `coord.CN`:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|---|---|-----|
| `Unit` | string | Dataset `coord.CN` | no | One physical unit or empty if the data does not have any physical unit |

#### Coordinate related measured values

Further measured values can be recorded for each coordinate measuring point. These are stored in individual data sets. In the following the definition of these data sets:

| Element | Description |
|--|------|
| value | Simple character string for identifying data of type Coordinates |
| . | Separators
| V | Additional character for identifying data of type value |
| N | Index number beginning with "0", increasing for each additional value set |

The data set is defined as follows:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|--|---|---|--|--|
| value.VN | A primitive or extended data type | *CHANNEL_NAME* | yes | Single |

The following attributes are assigned to this type of data set `value.VN`:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|---|---|-----|
| `Type` | string | Dataset `value.VN` | no | Describes the content and type of the data it contains. |

#### Sample Index

If datasets are created for coordinates, a data set on the same level and with the name `sampleindex` must be available. The index number of an entry in `coord.CN`, is entered as the start of the next group. If the data set `sampleindex` has a value of $21$ at index zero, the first $20$ entries from the data set `coord.CN` belong together, the next data group start at with index number $21$. The number of entries in `sampleindex` corresponds to the one in the data set `timestamp`.

The group sizes can vary among themselves, this can be seen from the index positions in `sampleIndex`.

*Example*  
The rail cross profile serves as an example here. At one point on the railroad track, several data points of a rail profile are measured and stored. A channel with the name `coord.C0` for the X-axis and `coord.C1` is created for the Y-axis.

The data set `sampleindex` now contains the number of entries that belong together.  

Below is a picture of a rail cross section measurement with about 2000 measuring points:

![Image of a rail cross section measurement](images/rail-cross-profile.jpg)

### Pictures

Images can be saved in compressed or uncompressed form. The format of the images is stored in an attribute so that the image can be read correctly.  
Images are stored as binary data blocks, so an image results in a data set.
All images are stored in a group called `IMG`. All images in this group have the same properties that are stored in the attributes.  

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|----|--|
| `IMG` | *DATASOURCE_NAME* | no |

The group `IMG` gets the following attributes for the more detailed description of the images contained therein:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|---|---|-----|
| ImageContentType | string | `IMG` | yes | Image content type, for example `JPEG` |
| ResolutionType | Enum | `IMG` | no | Description in chapter [Image resolution types](#image-resolution-types) |
| ResolutionInfoX | 32 bit float | `IMG` | no | Resolution in X direction |
| ResolutionInfoY | 32 bit float | `IMG` | no | Resolution in Y-direction |

Images can have different resolutions in X and Y direction, this must be considered for a correct representation and evaluation of the images.

#### Image resolution types

The 'ResolutionType' attribute contains information about the values of the 'ResolutionInfoX' and 'ResolutionInfoY' attributes.  
ResolutionType' can contain the following values: 'none', 'mmPerPixel' or 'dimension

**`none`**  
No information available.  

**`mmPerPixel`**  
Defines the pixel size in mm. The values in `ResolutionInfoX` and `ResolutionInfoY` give information about the real size of a pixel in millimeters.  

**`dimension`**  
Defines the resolution of the image. The values in `ResolutionInfoX` and `ResolutionInfoY` give information about the image size in pixels.  

#### Naming the data set for an image

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|---|-----|--|--|--|
| img.NNNNNNNNN | integer, bit depth depending on color depth | `IMG` | no | image |

The images are named according to the following pattern: `img.NNNNNNNNN`, hereinafter a description of the individual elements.

| Element | Description |
|--|-------|
| img | String for the name of an image |
| . | Separators.
| NNNNNNNNN | Picture number, beginning with 000000000 (nine characters)|

### Videos

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|---|-----|--|--|--|
| vid.NNNNNNNNN | integer, bit depth depending on color depth | `VID` | no | image |

As with the images, videos can be saved in compressed or uncompressed form. 
Videos are stored as streams in individual blocks. The blocks are single datasets with a given name.

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| VID | *DATASOURCE_NAME* | no |

#### Name of the data set for a video

A video data block is named according to the following pattern: `vid.NNNNNNNNN`, hereinafter a description of the individual elements.

| Element | Description |
|--|---|
| vid | String for the name of a video |
| . | Separator |
| NNNNNNNNN | Video number, starting with 000000000 (nine characters), ascending +1|

## Time-based data structures

### Timestamp

Each entry in a data set of a channel has a reference to an entry in a data set with the name `timestamp`, which lies within the data source group. In this `timestamp` data set, there are as many entries as there are entries in a data set of a channel.  

The time stamps are always stored in ascending order.  

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|----|---|----|---|----|
| timestamp | Timestamp | *DATASOURCE_NAME* | no | `Array` |

These time stamps are recorded either by a defined distance travelled or by a frequency, this is described in more detail in the chapter [Trigger mode](#triggermode).

### Durations

If data is recorded that is valid for a certain period of time, the data set with the name `duration` is added to the data set `timestamp`. The timestamp recorded in the `timestamp` data set specifies the time at which the value was recorded and the `duration` data set specifies how long this value is valid in nanoseconds. The data set `duration` is `timestamp` within a data source group next to the data set.  

The differentiation between discrete (data for discrete `timestamp`) and continuous (data for `timestamp` with `duration`) data is done on data source level. The existence or absence of a `duration` array defines if the data source is **"Discrete"** (no `duration` array) or **"Continuous"** (with `duration` array).

Example: Assuming there is a data source with a temperature value every second and a calculated average temperature for every minute. Such an average temperature would be stored in a continuous data source, within an array, with a duration of 60 sec.

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|--|---|-----|--|--|
| duration | 64 bit integer | *DATASOURCE_NAME* | **no** for continuous values, otherwise **yes** | `Array` |

## RCM-DX file format  

The RCM-DX consists of a file format of the HDF5-group [www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) in version 2.0. This allows to save the data in a tree structure. This structure, or rather the naming of the groups and datasets, is not specified by the HDF5 group, but by the RCM-DX specified here. The datasets can hold different data, what exactly is contained is specified as metadata.

A change to the structure means a new version and thus a new release of this specification.

To read and write the HDF5 file format, the HDF5 group offers libraries for different languages. These can read and write the structure specified here without problems.

Further information about the structure of the HDF5 file format can be found under the following link: [www.portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Introduction+to+HDF5](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Introduction+to+HDF5)

## RCM-DX data hierarchy  

In the RCM-DX, the individual groups and datasets as well as their names are defined. Below is an overview of the structure specified in this document:

![RCM-DX structure overview](images/generated/RCM_DX_Structure.png)
![RCM-DX file example](images/generated/RCM_DX_File_Example.png)

Separate and more detailed specifications have been written for individual structure groups. Several measuring instruments can be installed on one measuring platform. Each of these measuring devices generates new channels of data, which flow into the RCM-DX. Since these channels can be different for each measuring device, the specifications were separated. Another reason for this is the fact that other railway operators use different measuring and inspection equipment.

The individual groups are specified in more detail below in the subcategories.

### Root

Root is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

The root group contains all other subgroups. This group defines the RCM-DX and bears its name and thus refers to this specification.

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| `RCMDX` | none (this is the root node) | no |

![Root group overview](images/generated/rcmdx_root_group.png){width=400px}

#### Attributes  

The following attributes are assigned to the group `RCMDX`:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|---|---|-----|

A session configuration is a set of parameters or settings about the session. These can include the rail network (topology), the IT network, or other  configurations. Measurement system configurations are stored in a separate Group.

Configurations can be stored in the datasets of this group. The datasets are designed so that global and network specific configurations can be stored. The configuration can change and have not to be the same in each session.

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| `CONFIGURATION` | *SESSION_NAME* | no |

![Session configuration group overview](images/generated/rcmdx_session_configuration_group.png)

### Topology

Topology is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

A topology group contains all information on the route network of the respective railway company.  
This chapter proposes an optimised solution for SBB and may differ between railway companies. SBB's data processing chain provides for this structure, which is why it is described here. Other variants are allowed as long as dependencies on other Groups such as the Groups SECTION and POSITION are taken into account.
The Group TOPOLOGY is not optional, if the RCM-DX format is intended to be self-containing. The Group TOPOLOGY is optional and can be omitted, if the topology is saved outside the RCM-DX format, for example in an external database.

| Name | HDF5 Type | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|---|--|
| `TOPOLOGY` | HDF5 Group | `CONFIGURATION` | no (self-containing format) / yes (not self-containing format)|

![Topology group overview](images/generated/rcmdx_topology_group.png)

The DfA (Database of fixed assets) is a SBB construct and reflects the SBB route network. The data comes from a database and is distributed as a file to the SBB measuring vehicles. They can read the information contained therein and also add it to the RCM-DX. This DfA is used for positioning and it is therefore possible to assign the measured data to an object from the route network.

**Diamond-Metadata Attributes**

List of attributes defined by SBB Diamond. All attributes start with “diamond-“ and have a String value.

### Measuring System

Measurement system is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

Each measuring system has its own data sources, which have their own names, as well as their own channels, which in turn have their own names. Common features are described in this specification, everything else is defined in a separate specification. Since this part differs greatly among railway companies and with measuring equipment, a rigid specification has been dispensed with, but a certain framework is still given.

A group is created for each system that collects data. The name of the group is unique for each system. The composition of this name is not predefined.

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| *MEASURINGSYSTEM_NAME* | `SESSION` | no |

![Measuring system overview](images/generated/rcmdx_measuringsystem_group.png){width=400px}

#### Attributes  

The following attributes are contained in the group of the measuring system:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|-----|---|-----|
| Element | string | *MEASURINGSYSTEM_NAME* | no | Indicates the type of the group, this is fixed `System` |

### Datasource

Datasource is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

A data source group can contain several channels and thus several data sources. This group combines these channels. The naming can be freely selected, but must be unique.

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| *DATASOURCE_NAME* | *MEASURINGSYSTEM_NAME* | no |

A timestamp is available for each individual measuring point within a data source group. There are two types of data acquisition for a data source group. One is always after a defined distance (e.g. every 250 millimeters) and the other is the recording of measurement data at a certain frequency (e.g. 4000 Hz).
The way the measurement data was recorded is shown in two attributes for each channel group. For a description see [Trigger mode](#triggermode).

![Datasource group overview](images/generated/rcmdx_datasource_group.png){width=320px}

#### Attributes

The following attribute is assigned to the group:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Description |
|---|---|-----|---|-----|
| Element | string | *DATASOURCE_NAME* | no | Contains the type of the group, this is fix `Datasource` |

#### Example

In our example the name of the data source group is assigned, which should contain our environmental measurement data, which we call `ENVIRONMENT`.

#### Timestamp data set

Each data source group contains a data set called `timestamp`. It contains all timestamps at which a measurement was recorded. The size of this list of timestamps is the same as the size of the datasets per channel.

A more detailed description can be found in the chapter [Timestamp Array](#timestamp)!

### Channel

Channel is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

A channel group contains metadata for the actual measurement data available in the channel. The naming can be freely selected, but must be unique within the data source group.
Some attributes as TriggerMode are the same for each channel of the same `DATASOURCE`. This is done intentionally to have all attributes in the group `CHANNEL` without the need of the attributes of the parent object.

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| *CHANNEL_NAME* | *DATASOURCE_NAME* | no |

![Channel group overview](images/generated/rcmdx_channel_group.png)

| Element | string | *CHANNEL_NAME* | no | Contains the type of the group, this is fix `Channel` |

**CommonTriggerDistance**  
Data is collected every `value` meters.

> In a channel group there is always only one common trigger value! The other trigger value is set to "0.0"

> Both trigger values have the value "0.0" if `TriggerMode` contains the value `EVENTS`.

**CommonTriggerFrequency**  
Data is collected with a frequency of `value` Hertz.

> In a channel group there is always only one common trigger value! The other trigger value is set to "0.0"

> Both trigger values have the value "0.0" if `TriggerMode` contains the value `EVENTS`.

**ChannelBasis**  
Defines the applicable side of the data signal in relation to the vehicle or moving direction. A sensor can be installed on one side of the platform. Depending on the direction and the orientation of the vehicle, this can be 'left' or 'right' in relation to the movement but is always fixed in relation to the vehicle frame axes. 

![Explanation of Sensor location an detection](images/Picture_ChannelBasis.png)

Possible values are:

| Value | Description |
|----|----|
| TOTAL | The channel has no dependency on direction of motion or vehicle orientation |
| SENSOR_LEFT | Deprecated – same as ``SENSOR_VERTICAL_LEFT`` |
| SENSOR_RIGHT | Deprecated – same as ``SENSOR_VERTICAL_RIGHT`` |
| RAIL_LEFT | Deprecated – same as ``MOVE_DIRECTION_VERTICAL_LEFT`` |
| RAIL_RIGHT | Deprecated – same as ``MOVE_DIRECTION_VERTICAL_RIGHT`` |
| SENSOR_VERTICAL_LEFT | The sensor is located on the left-hand side of the measurement platform and detects signals in a vertical plane, providing a top-down or bottom-up view|
| SENSOR_VERTICAL_RIGHT | The sensor is located on the right-hand side of the measurement platform and detects signals in a vertical plane, providing a top-down or bottom-up view |
| MOVE_DIRECTION_VERTICAL_LEFT | The sensor detects signals on the left-hand side with respect to the direction of motion, irrespective of its orientation |
| MOVE_DIRECTION_VERTICAL_RIGHT | The sensor detects signals on the right-hand side with respect to the direction of motion, irrespective of its orientation |
| SENSOR_VERTICAL_TOTAL | The sensor is located at the center of the measurement platform and detects signals in a vertical plane, providing a top-down or bottom-up view |
| MOVE_DIRECTION_VERTICAL_TOTAL | The sensor detects signals in the center with respect to the direction of motion, irrespective of its orientation |

**MoveDirAutoInvert**  
Flag that implies, if set to true, that measurement data of this channel is dependent on direction and should be inverted if viewed with a section of different direction.    
> If the flag is set to false, not set or only data of a single direction is viewed, then no inversion is needed when viewing data of this channel.

**MeasurementType**  
Defines how a value was created. This can be measured, calculated or taken from a previously defined data source that was read from there and inserted into the file.

The following values are possible:

| Value | Description |
|---|---------|
| MEASURED_VALUE | Measured values |
| REFERENCE_VALUE | A setpoint of a third source |

An example for reference values are defined target values which flow in from another source (file, database etc.) and are to be used for comparisons.

**Neighbor**  
Refers to the name of an adjacent channel. This can be the right rail, for example, when measuring the track temperature of the left rail.
Thus the attribute `neighbor` of the channel "TEMP_RAIL_**L**" would contain the name "TEMP_RAIL_**R**" and vice versa.

**MeasurementUncertaintyType**  
Defines the type in which the measurement uncertainty is set, namely absolute (in which case it has the same unit as the channel itself), or relative (in which case it has no unit).
The following values are thus allowed:

| Value | Description |
|---|---------|
| ABSOLUTE | Absolute values |
| RELATIVE | Relative values |

This attribute is optional. If it is not set, no information is known about the measurement uncertainty. 

**LowerMeasurementUncertainty**  
This attribute contains the measurement accuracy of the channel according to the specifications of the measurement system. This is the lower bound for the measurement uncertainty range. This attribute is optional. If it is not set, no information is known about the measurement uncertainty.

**UpperMeasurementUncertainty**  
This attribute contains the measurement accuracy of the channel according to the specifications of the measurement system. This is the upper bound for the measurement uncertainty range. This attribute is optional. If it is not set, no information is known about the measurement uncertainty.

**PositionOffset**  
Describes the distance between a defined zero point (position) on the measuring vehicle and a the measuring sensor. This specification is used to convert the exact time at which the measurement was taken to a defined zero point. The value can be positive or negative and has the unit millimeter.  

#### TriggerMode

This attribute defines how the data was recorded.

Possible values are:

| Value | Description | Unit |
|---|----------|---|
| TIME | Time-based measurement data recording | Nanoseconds |
| DISTANCE | Distance-based measurement data acquisition | Millimeter |
| EVENT | EVENT based recording | none |

#### Data object

Each channel group receives a data set with the actual measurement data:

| Name | HDF5 Type | Optional |
|--|---|--|
| data | HDF5 Dataset | no |

> There are as many measurement data entries as there are timestamps in the data set `timestamp` which is included in the channel group.

The data set needs more information, this is given as attributes:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|----|---|----|---|----|
| Unit | string | *CHANNEL_NAME* | no | `Array` |

**Unit:**  
The physical unit of the measurement data, such as "millimeter". If no physical unit can be assigned to the data, this attribute remains empty.

The data set and the possible data that can be stored are described in more detail in the chapter [Dataset](#hdf5-datasets).

### Measurement mode

Measurement mode is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

The following group contains important information about the measurement mode of the system. The `MEASUREMENTMODE` is depending on the operational state of the measurement system, for example "productive".

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| `MEASUREMENTMODE` | *MEASURINGSYSTEM_NAME* | yes |

The group `MEASUREMENTMODE` contains one attribute:

| WARNING | The measuring system or the sensor may have had a failure and the measured values may not be correct. |

#### Consistency

Consistency is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

The message about the consistency of the data is triggered by a system that checks all data according to certain criteria. For example, this could be a check for black images in a video. If all frames in the video are black, something is wrong and the video is unusable. 

| Name | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|--|
| `CONSISTENCY` | `LOGGING` | yes |

The group `CONSISTENCY` contains one dataset:

### Position

Position is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

This group contains general information on the position. It is like a measuring system (see [Measuring System](#measuring-system)) with following differences:

>	The channel with the position data has multiple (nine) datasets. This is because a position record always consists of these nine values and therefore this dataset is hardcoded, instead of configurable as for all other measurement systems.

>	The channel and datasets have no attributes (e.g., physical unit) because this information is part of the file format and not configurable.

This group has dependencies to the group `TOPOLOGY`.

### EVENTS

Events is of type 'Group' in HDF5.

The EVENTS group is used to store events that occurred during the recording of data. Events are bound to a channel, system or session and have a link to it.
Systems can, for example, trigger an EVENT when a limit value is exceeded. Events are always time-bound which means an EVENT contains the exact time of occurrence and the duration of the EVENT. The duration can also be zero, so the EVENT occurred exactly at the specified time.  

| Name | HDF5 Type | Parent object | Optional |
|--|--|---|--|
| `EVENTS` | HDF5 Group | *SESSION_NAME* | yes |

Within the group there are the following data fields:

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|----|---|----|---|----|
| Element | string | `EVENTS`` |no | Equals to "Events". Identifies this node.|
| systemref | string | `EVENTS` | no | `Array` |
| channelref | string | `EVENTS` | yes | `Array` |

**data**
This data set contains the actual information about an EVENT, this in the XML notation which is described in more detail in each chapter of the EVENT types (Defect EVENT type, Detected object EVENT type, Limit EVENT type).  
A type can be stored for each EVENT. These are explained in more detail below.

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|----|---|----|---|----|
| data | string | `EVENTS` | no | `Array` |

**duration**
Defines for each EVENT the duration of the EVENT itself. This value can also be zero.

**type**
Contains the type of an EVENT.

| Name | Data type | Parent object | Optional | Storage type |
|----|---|----|---|----|

In the list "type" the type of the recorded EVENT is shown. The different types contain different information which is shown in the following subchapters. There are corresponding XML schemas for all types that define the technical specifications.

#### Defect EVENT type

This event contains information about elements found in the 2-dimensional data (for example a picture) that exceed defined thresholds. A defect can be, for example, an image of a rail showing a damage of the surface. This defect is recorded by a system. However, it may happen that this error is not one (incorrectly detected), this information can be specified afterwards (attribute "PossibleValidationResults").
Defects are always channel bound and recorded or evaluated by a system.
In the following, the elements and attributes that occur in a *Defect* as XML are described in more detail.

The XML Schema can be found in the chapter [EventsDefect](#events-defect).
