## Where to get help

Help is provided through the issue tracker. If you have a question, please create an issue in our issue board.

## What do I need to know

Requests for changes are evaluated by a committee. If the request is useful for the majority, it is included in an upcoming release. Don't be angry with us if it doesn't make it into the next release or even if it doesn't make it into a release at all.  
Major changes to this specification will result in major changes in the software that follows this specification, so such changes are well thought out and take some time.

## How can I contribute
