# Contributing to the RCM-DX Specification

First of all, thank you very much for your help!

## Where to get help

Help is provided through the issue tracker. If you have a question, please create an issue with the Label "question" in our issue board.

## What do I need to know

Requests for changes are evaluated by a committee. If the request is useful for the majority, it is included in an upcoming release. Don't be angry with us if it doesn't make it into the next release or even if it doesn't make it into a release at all.  
Major changes to this specification will result in major changes in the software that follows this specification, so such changes are well thought out and take some time.

## How can I contribute

### Any bugs found

In the specification, these can be spelling mistakes, grammar errors, errors in the pictograms, errors in the links (or broken links) and so on. Mistakes happen, and we would be grateful if you could let us know by creating an issue or even sending a pull request that fixes the problem!  

### Suggest improvements or new features

Improvements are desired and contribute to the success of this project. To suggest an improvement or a new feature, create a new issue with the label "enhancement", or a pull request.

### Participate and decide

It is our goal to build an inclusive Open Source community around this project. If you want to participate in the ongoing development of the specification, please get in touch via the issue tracker or email (rcm@sbb.ch).
